# mantis_abm_germany

This project focuses on the expansion of the thermophilic species Mantis religiosa in Germany, utilizing agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate its prospective dissemination over the next 30 years. The model leverages data from GBIF and CORINE land cover classification to predict the species' distribution. 

The integration of surface temperature and eleavation data could not be realised so far, so that no statement can be made about the status of the spread in 30 years. Only when a climate projection is integrated into NetLogo will it make sense to run the model up to tick 30. A validation run for the year 2023 was carried out for this status. Future iterations incorporating additional variables will enhance the model's accuracy and reliability, aiding in the development of effective management and conservation strategies for M. religiosa in Germany.
